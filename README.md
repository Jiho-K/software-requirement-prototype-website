# software-requirement-prototype-website

This 'website' uses basic HTML and CSS to create a 'prototype' to demonstrate what a car website would look like for a software requirement course.
JavaScript will also be used to make the website more dynamic and enhance the user experience.

To run this, download the repository and open index.html on any web browser.

Please note that this prototype has been designed for 1920x1080 resolution.
